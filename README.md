# Capital by Claude – Trading Extension

Capital by Claude is an experimental paper trading browser extension built for the Pump.fun ecosystem.

It tracks trades executed on supported Solana trading terminals and evaluates performance using an AI-driven analysis pipeline. The goal is to identify skilled trenchers and qualify them for future funding challenges.

## What this is

- A **paper trading extension**
- Designed for **Pump.fun and Solana memecoin trading**
- Built as part of the **Pump.fun Hackathon**
- Early prototype, not production software

## How it works

1. The extension observes trades made on supported terminals  
2. Trade data is analyzed off-chain  
3. Performance metrics such as PnL, consistency, and risk profile are evaluated  
4. Users can progress through simulated challenges based on results  

Funding mechanics and live capital are **not enabled** in this version.

## Supported terminals (planned)

- Photon  
- Axiom  
- Terminal  

Support may be partial or mocked depending on the environment.
